Subject: [vx-discuss] verification R library<br>
<br>
Hi,<br>
<br>
This is just to inform R users that NCAR's verification group has
created a library of verification functions in R.&nbsp; It is available
on the R website at <a href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</a>.&nbsp;
From the main page, go to CRAN (left banner), pick a nearby mirror
site, then select contributed.&nbsp; Also available at this site it all
the other information you need to know about R.<br>
<br>
If you have R installed you can get the package by typing <b>install.packages(verification)</b> in Linux.&nbsp; Window user can select the package from those listed on CRAN.<br>
<br>
This is a first version of the package and it contains functions for a
lot of routine verification graphics and statistics.&nbsp; These
include ROC plots, attribute diagrams, reliability plots and
conditional quantile plots along with documentation and examples.&nbsp;
New features include a measurement error function developed by William
(Matt) Briggs and David Ruppert and a spatial scale verification
function developed&nbsp; by Barbara Casati (soon to be updated.)<br>
<br>
I hope to update the package early next year and I would like some
suggestions and feedback as to what might be useful.&nbsp; Some
suggestions have included, verification of circular (directional)
forecasts (Tilmann Gneiting) and confidence intervals for everything.
This last item will be the subject of another message.&nbsp; If you
work in R and have a routine or function that you would like to share,
I would be happy to include it and help you with documentation and
example creation.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Matt<br>
