<b>Verification Song</b> (to the tune of Waltzing Matilda) <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Ian Jolliffe<p>

Once a jolly scientist came to a workshop <br>
In the land of the coolibah tree<br>
And he sang as he made his poster and his powerpoint,<br>
"Who'll come a-verifying forecasts with me?"<br>
"Verifying forecasts, verifying forecasts, who'll come a verifying forecasts with me?"<br>
And he sang as he made his poster and his powerpoint,<br>
"Who'll come a-verifying forecasts with me?"<p>

Along came some forecasts, escaping from the Bureau<br>
Up jumped the scientist and grabbed them with glee<br>
And he sang as he stuffed those forecasts in his R package,<br>
"Who'll come a-verifying forecasts with me?"<br>
"Verifying forecasts, verifying forecasts, who'll come a verifying forecasts with me?"<br>
And he sang as he stuffed those forecasts in his R package,<br>
"Who'll come a-verifying forecasts with me?"<p>

Up came the forecaster, hotfoot from his lonely shift<br>
Up came his bosses, one, two, three<br>
Where are those forecasts you've got in your R package<br>
Who'll come a-verifying forecasts with me?<br>
Verifying forecasts, verifying forecasts, who'll come a verifying forecasts with me?<br>
Where are those forecasts you've got in your R package<br>
Who'll come a-verifying forecasts with me?<p>

Up jumped the scientist and laughed at the forecaster<br>
You'll never see them again, said he<br>
They've been downscaled, smoothed, and now they need recalibrating<br>
You'll come a-verifying forecasts with me!<br>
Verifying forecasts, verifying forecasts, you'll come a verifying forecasts with me!<br>
They've been downscaled, smoothed, and now they need recalibrating<br>
You'll come a-verifying forecasts with me!<br>
