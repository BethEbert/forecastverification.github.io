<P> Extreme events can be defined in different ways, depending on the users and purposes of the study. 
Extremes can be maxima or minima, they can be regarded as rare events, they can be defined by their magnitude 
or based on their socio-economical impacts. A definition often used in statistics (and which embraces some 
of the previous ones) is: <B><I> extreme events are events in the tail of the distribution. </I></B> Before
addressing the analysis and verification/validation of extremes, it is essential to clearly define the 
extremes themselves. </P> 

<P> Several recent studies in weather and climate and related sciences have focused on extremes. 
From the user's perspective, extremes have high social and economical impacts. Climate studies project 
an increase in extreme frequency and magnitude. The progressively higher temporal and spatial 
resolution of NWP model enables to better resolve (some) extreme events. Analysis and verification/validation 
of extreme events plays a key role since (1) it enhances understanding of the capability of our models in 
predicting extremes, and (2) it helps decision makers in developing adaptation strategies to mitigate impact 
and losses. </P>

<P> Statistical analysis of extreme events is challenging for several reasons. Extremes are often characterized 
by large values (and outliers): robust and resistant statistics are necessary for their treatment. Extreme 
events are often rare events: these are characterized by a small sample, and therefore large uncertainties. 
Observations for extremes events might also be poor or sub-sampled because of technical difficulties related 
to the extreme weather itself (e.g., extreme cold temperatures in the Arctic are generally recoded in winter, 
when fewer observations are available).
Pooling in space and time alleviate the effects of the small sample size, however inhomogeneity and 
non-stationarity ought to be kept in account. Alternatively, statistical analysis of moderate extremes can 
be used to infer the behaviour of more extreme events. Small samples in a categorical approach can result 
also in unstable statistics, over-sensitivity to the bias and/or non-informative asymptotic limits. </P>

<P> <B><I> Extreme Value Theory (EVT) </I></B> is the branch of statistics which studies the properties of 
extreme values, and enables them to be fit with theoretical distributions (or <I>probability models</I>).
Such theoretical distributions enable one to describe the behaviour of extremes through the estimation of 
few key parameters. The use of theoretical distributions and their parameters leads to three major 
advantages: 1. Properties of the population and/or very large extremes can be inferred from the EVT 
theoretical distributions (even if these are not observed in the actual sample). 2. Trends in the extremes 
(e.g., due to climate change) and/or dependence of extreme events to specific covariates (e.g., annual and 
diurnal cycles, North Atlantic Oscillation) can be accounted for by using a non-stationary model for the 
EVT distribution parameters. 3. EVT distributions are suitable and optimally handle right-skewed distributions 
characterized by large values and outliers (such as extreme distributions). EVT distribution parameters can 
therefore provide robust and resistant measures of extremes typical values and variability, as an example. 
The use of the EVT distributions and their parameters plays often a key role in extracting the signal from 
empirical (and often noisy) extreme data.</P>

<P> The capabilities of EVT have been only recently explored by the climate and weather research community. 
The use of EVT is radically different within the two communities, due to the different spatial and temporal 
matching requirements and different time scales. Climate does not require an exact time matching, therefore 
climate studies focus on the analysis and comparison of marginal distributions obtained over 30 or more years 
(e.g., future versus present climate). In weather forecasts, on the other hand, the events require a more exact 
matching in space and time, therefore verification approaches focus on the behaviour of the forecast and 
observation joint distribution. Therefore, analysis and validation of climate extremes use EVT for univariate 
distributions, whereas extreme weather verification uses EVT for bivariate distributions. Climate and weather 
community approaches are complementary -- both communities could gain from method exchanges and collaborations. </P>

<P>Early verification studies have analyzed the behaviour of traditional binary categorical verification 
scores for extreme and rare events (Schaefer, 1990; Doswell <i>et al.</i>, 1990; Marzban, 1998; Goeber, 2004). 
Most of these studies have shown that the verification scores in extreme and rare event situations are overly 
sensitive to the bias and encourage either under- or over-forecasting. Few studies have investigated the 
mathematical limits of the scores as the events become rarer: Schaefer (1990) showed that the ETS converges 
to the TS as the base rate tends to zero; Doswell <i>et al.</i> (1990) showed that the PSS converges to the hit rate 
as the number of correct rejections becomes larger relative to the other entries in the contingency table. 
Goeber (2004) and Stephenson <i>et al.</i> (2008) show that most of the categorical scores converge to trivial limits 
(either zero or infinity) as the events get more and more extreme and rare. </P>

<P>Ferro (2007) and Stephenson et al (2008) propose a verification approach based on EVT for bivariate distributions. 
Both studies are inspired by the study by Coles <i>et al.</i> (1999) on dependence measures for extreme values. 
Ferro (2007) proposes a <A HREF="http://www.bom.gov.au/bmrc/wefor/staff/eee/verif/Ferro/Verif_rare_events.html">
probability model</A> to represent the asymptotic behaviour of forecast and observation joint distribution as 
the events get more and more rare. Stephenson <i>et al.</i> (2008) propose a non-vanishing measure for extreme event 
verification, the Extreme Dependency Score (EDS). Both the probability model parameters and the EDS depend on 
the rate of convergence to zero of the hit rate as the events get rarer. Note that the EDS is one of the two 
parameters considered in Ferro (2007).</P>

<P> Neighbourhood (fuzzy) verification approaches (e.g., Ebert, 2008) have been recently used for extreme weather 
verification to alleviate the requirement of exact spatial and temporal matching between observed and forecast events 
(quite a strict requirement, given the low predictability of extreme and rare events). </P>

<P> There is not consensus between Weather Services on which technique is optimal to verify extremes. Extreme 
events themselves are often defined by exceedance of fixed thresholds, which depend on the local climatology or 
some specific application. A suite of standard statistics could help monitoring and intercomparisons.</P>

A suite of standard indices related to extremes in daily temperature and precipitation has been identified 
(Frich <i>et al.</i>, 2002) and later amplified (<A HREF="http://cccma.seos.uvic.ca/ETCCDI/docs/ETCCDMIndicesComparison1.pdf">
Index List</A>) by the joint CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), 
in an international effort coordinated by WMO/WCRP (<A HREF="http://cccma.seos.uvic.ca/ETCCDI">http://cccma.seos.uvic.ca/ETCCDI</A>). 
These indices are used both to monitor extremes in the present climate (e.g., Vincent and Mekis, 2006), and to 
analyze the evolution of extremes with Climate Change (e.g. Tebaldi <i>et al.</i>, 2006). Statistical significance of the 
indices trend is usually assessed along with their distributions and geographical location.</LI>
<BR>
<LI> <B> Evaluation and analysis of return values obtained from extreme value distributions</B>.<BR>
EVT describe two types of theoretical distributions fitting extreme values: the Block Maxima (e.g. maximum annual temperature) are described by the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, whereas the magnitude of Peaks over Threshold (PoT) are fitted with the Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. Most climate studies use GEV distributions to define extreme event return values (extreme value exceeded once every T years), and then analyze the changes in the return values with Climate Change (e.g., Kharin <i>et al.</i>, 2007; Fowler <i>et al.</i>, 2007). Stationary fits by using L-moments are usually used on two (present and future) time windows, however recent studies are considering maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to determine covariates and time evolution of the extreme distributions with Climate Change. The PoT approach has also been recently embraced, since it enables the use of a larger data sample than the Block Maxima approach.</LI>
</OL> 
Due to the great scale mis-match between climate model grids and station observations, validation of climate models is usually performed versus re-analyses (Gleckler <i>et al.</i>, 2008). The representativeness error is quite dramatic when considering precipitation extremes. Upscaling techniques (to interpolate observed extremes to the model grid) or areal correction factors (to infer extreme local values from the grid-box areal-average estimates) are sometimes applied. Direct comparison of climate models versus observed extremes is usually used to define downscaling relations.
