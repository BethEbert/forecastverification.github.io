<Is there a difference between "verification"
and "validation"?</h3></center>

<p><br>It seems the two words, <i>verification</i>
and <i>validation</i>, are often used interchangeably, to mean something
like "to assess the accuracy of".
<p>The American Heritage Dictionary of the
English Language defines these two words as follows:
<p><b>val.i.date</b> - 1. To declare or make
legally valid.&nbsp; 2. To mark with an indication of official sanction.&nbsp;
3. To substantiate; verify.
<p><b>ver.i.fy</b> - 1. To prove the truth
of by the presentation of evidence or testimony; substantiate. 2. To determine
or test the truth or accuracy of, as by comparison, investigation, or reference:
"Findings are not accepted by scientists unless they can be verified."
