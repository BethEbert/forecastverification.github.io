<h3>Relative value (value score)</h3>

<p><i><b>Answers the question: </b>For a <a href="#cost-loss">cost/loss
ratio</a> C/L for taking action based on a forecast, what is the relative
improvement in economic value between climatalogical and perfect information?</i>
<p><b>Range:</b> minus infinity to 1.&nbsp; <b>Perfect score:</b> 1.
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> The relative value is a skill score of expected
expense, with climatology as the reference forecast. Because the cost/loss
ratio is different for different users of forecasts, the value is generally
plotted as a function of <i>C/L</i>.

Like <a href="../../index.html#ROC">ROC</a>,
it gives information that can be used in decision making. When applied
to a probabilistic forecasts system (for example, an ensemble prediction
system), the optimal value for a given <i>C/L</i> may be achieved by a
different forecast probability threshold than the optimal value for a different
<i>C/L</i>.
In this case it is necessary to compute relative value curves for the entire
range of probabilities, then select the optimal values (the upper envelope
of the relative value curves) to represent the value of the probabilistic
forecast system.
<p><a NAME="cost-loss"></a><b>More information: </b>The relative value
assumes a cost-loss decision making model, in which the cost for taking
action is <i>C</i> (whether the event occurs or not), and the loss incurred
if the event occurs but no action is taken is <i>L</i>. The expense matrix
is shown below.

<p>For a forecast based on climatological information alone, one would
either always take action or never take action, whichever is cheaper, yielding
an optimal expected mean expense of min(<i>C</i>, <i>P<sub>clim</sub>*L</i>).
The mean expense for a particular forecast system over a sample of <i>N</i>
forecasts&nbsp; is obtained by multiplying the expense matrix by the <a href="../../index.html#Contingency table">2x2
contingency table</a> to yield 1/<i>N</i> (hits*<i>C</i> + false_alarms*<i>C</i>
+ misses*<i>L</i>). For a perfect forecast with no misses or false alarms
the mean expense would be <i>P<sub>clim</sub>*C.</i> It can be shown that
the maximum value of <i>V</i> occurs where the cost/loss ratio equals the
climatological probability, and that the value at this point is equal to
the <a href="../../index.html#HK">Hanssen and Kuipers discriminant</a>.
<p>When applied to probabilistic forecasts the envelope of relative value
curves represents the <i>potential</i> value since all decision thresholds
are possible. In practice a user would choose an optimal decision threshold
for his/her cost/loss ratio based on past performance, and apply this threshold
to future (independent) forecasts. This <i>actual</i> value may be lower
than the potential value if the conditions vary in time, or if the size
of the sample used to estimate the optimal decision threshold was too small
<a href="#Atger 2001">(Atger, 2001)</a>. Also, the value of a probabilistic forecast 
system will not be truly optimal unless the forecasts are reliable (unbiassed), 
which may require some calibration.
