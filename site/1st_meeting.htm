<UL>
</B><LI>We have only verified the "interesting" cases from the 3-month period, i.e., those days with interesting weather (about 1/3 of total). We discussed the idea of completing the verification on the entire period, but nobody seemed very enthusiastic. </LI>
<LI>The link from the WWRP Home Page to the S2000 FDP is broken and needs to be fixed. </LI>
<LI>The papers going into the special issue of <I>Weather and Forecasting</I> on the Sydney FDP could also be published as a report in the WWRP publication series, to enable people who don’t have access to AMS Journals (mainly developing countries) to learn about nowcasting. Rit was enthusiastic about this idea. This would require (a) permission from the authors, (b) permission from the American Meteorological Society since they own the copyright. BB will send a 1-page memo on this to Rit, cc to Tom Keenan (editor of special issue).</LI></UL>

<B><P>Other FDPs</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>In the Sydney 2000 FDP the scientists running the applications would have liked to be able to access (standardized) real-time verification capabilities. This is something the verification group could work toward in future FDPs. </LI>
<LI>It doesn’t appear that the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics will have a FDP since there isn’t enough time to organize it. </LI>
<LI>The 2006 Winter Olympics will be held in Turino, Italy. It might be possible to have a FDP but it could look different from the Sydney one since the weather is expected to be much different! </LI>
<LI>The 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics will very likely have a FDP. It would be based at the Beijing Met Bureau, with several foci: nowcasting, ensemble high-resolution mesoscale prediction, and air pollution. In the first half of 2003 Rit and a few others will go to Beijing to consult with the Met Bureau re the FDP. If all goes ahead, the verification group could consider putting together a real-time verification package.</LI></UL>

<B><P>Other verification activities</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Someone in the group suggested that an intercomparison of mesoscale models would be a good idea. </LI>
<LI>Chris Davis is the head of the Verification Working Group for the WRF model development. </LI>
<LI>Philippe Bougeault is doing some mesoscale model verification through WWRP or WGNE. </LI>
<LI>Rit suggested that our group, because of its history with the Sydney 2000 FDP, could formally become a subcommittee of the Science Steering Committee of the WWRP – the Verification Subcommittee. </LI></UL>

<B><P>Proposed verification web site</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>The group thought it would be very useful to produce a web site or toolbox on forecast verification. Everyone in the group could contribute to it. </LI>
<LI>The 3 November 2000 severe storm case from the Sydney FDP could be included as a demonstration case, with the data being downloadable for others to experiment with. </LI>
<LI>The page should include links to diagnostic methods and to other verification pages </LI>
<LI>BE volunteered to draft a framework for the page, to be circulated among the group. We should try to have something in place (even if incomplete) to promote at the QPF Conference in Reading in September.</LI></UL>
