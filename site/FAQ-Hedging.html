<center><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>What does "hedging" a forecast
mean?</font></font></b>

<p>The Oxford English dictionary defines "to hedge" as, "To avoid a definite
decision or commitment" or "to reduce one’s risk of loss on a bet or speculation
by compensating transactions on the other side". In more general terms,
to "hedge one’s bets" is "to protect oneself against loss or error by supporting
more than one side in a contest, an argument etc". In the context of forecasting
, hedging would mean the avoidance of a definite (specific or categorical)
forecast, opting instead for a probabilistic forecast. The forecaster,
instead of "putting all his eggs in one basket" and forecasting a single
outcome with 100% probability, hedges his bets by assigning non-zero probability
to more than one possible outcome.
<p>In terms of forecast verification, probability forecasts which avoid
the extremes of the probability range often receive more favorable scores,
especially with quadratic scoring rules such as the root mean square error
or Brier Score. This is because an extreme forecast is heavily penalized
if it is incorrect. Thus a forecaster can minimize his risk of obtaining
an unfavorable score on a particular forecast by hedging. At the same time,
he lowers the maximum positive score he can obtain if he is correct.
<p>In terms of forecast attributes as defined by Murphy (1993), hedged
forecasts lack sharpness; they are smooth; probabilities are assigned over
a broader range of possible outcomes. In the context of spatial forecasts,
hedging means a tendency to underforecast the intensity of systems or to
forecast the location of sharply defined features such as fronts with less
precision.
<p>"Hedging" has been given a somewhat different, but consistent interpretation
by Murphy and Epstein (1967) and Murphy (1978). These authors considered
only probabilistic forecasts, and defined hedging by the statement, "Hedging
is said to occur whenever a forecaster's judgment and forecast differ".
For example, if the forecaster truly believes the probability of an event
is 50%, but issues a forecast probability of 20%, motivated, for example,
by a desire to improve his verification score, then he is said to have
hedged his forecast.
<p>Apparent inconsistencies between this definition and the above arise
because of differences in restrictions placed on forecasts vis-&agrave;-vis
hedging. A categorical forecast may be required of a forecaster (he must
make a decision), and he is not given the opportunity to use probabilities
other than the categorical values of 0 and 100%. In such cases, given the
known uncertainty of future weather, a categorical forecast can be almost
always viewed as a hedged forecast in the sense that it does not correspond
with the forecaster's true belief about the likelihood of the chosen outcome.
At the same time, hedging by avoiding forecasts of extreme probabilities,
when this option is available, has been demonstrated many times to generally
improve verification scores, as stated above. However, this arises because
the forecaster is then allowed to forecast according to his true belief,
not because he has been able to "play the score". Further discussion of
this aspect is contained in the discussion of "strictly proper" scoring
rules elsewhere on this site.
