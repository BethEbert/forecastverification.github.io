<b>Linear error in probability
space (LEPS)</b>
<p>LEPS measures the error in probability space as opposed to measurement
space, where CDF<sub>o</sub>( ) is the cumulative probability distribution
of the observations, determined from an appropriate climatology (Ward and
Folland, 1991).
<p>The rationale behind transferring to probability space can be seen with
the following example. A forecast is made of a temperature 7<sup>o</sup>C
above average, and the verifying observation is 5<sup>o</sup>C above average.
On another occasion the forecast is 1<sup>o</sup>C above average and the
verifying observation is 1<sup>o</sup>C below average. In measurement space
both forecasts are equally good, but it can be argued that the first forecast,
which successfully forecasts an extreme value, is the better of the two.
Transforming to probability space reflects this argument, as can be seen
in the figure below.
<p>For notational convenience, let P<sub>f</sub> = CDF<sub>o</sub>(F<sub>i</sub>
), P<sub>v</sub> = CDF<sub>o</sub>(O<sub>i</sub> ). Then LEPS is simply
|P<sub>f</sub>-P<sub>v</sub>|.

<p>The basic form of LEPS has some disadvantages. Potts et al. (1996) adapted
the score to overcome these. The revised LEPS score is 3(1-|P<sub>f</sub>-P<sub>v</sub>|+P<sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>-P<sub>f</sub>+P<sub>v</sub><sup>2</sup>-P<sub>v</sub>)-1.
<p>This score is doubly equitable, it has simple values for unskilful (0)
and for perfect forecasts (1), and there is no ‘bending back’ for categorical
data. This last property refers to the fact that in the simpler form of
LEPS it is possible, for ordered categorical data, that forecasts which
are maximally incorrect are penalised less than those which are slightly
less erroneous.
<p>LEPS scores can be used on both continuous and categorical data, and
a skill score, taking values between –100 and 100 (or –1 and 1) for a set
of forecasts can be constructed based on the LEPS score, though it is not
doubly equitable.
