Correspondence Ratio</h3>
The correspondence ratio measures the ratio of the area of intersection
of two or more events to the combined area of those events (Stensrud and
Wandishin, 2000):

<p>where <i>F<sub>m,i</sub></i> is the value of forecast <i>m</i> at gridpoint
<i>i</i>,
and <i>O<sub>i</sub></i> is the corresponding observed value. In the diagram
<i>CR</i> is the ratio of the dark area to the total shaded area.
<p>In the case of two fields <i>CR</i> is identical to the <a href="../index.html#CSI">threat
score</a>; in general, <i>CR</i> can be thought of as a multi-dimensional
threat score. When computed as a function of event threshold it measures
the correspondence between fields for varying event amplitudes. For a given
threshold, the time evolution of <i>CR</i> measures the predictability
error growth of the event. The <i>CR</i> for an ensemble, not including
the observed field, measures the divergence of the ensemble. The correspondence
ratio behaves similar to the <a href="../index.html#AC">anomaly correlation</a>
but is better suited to discontinuous fields (such as rainfall) because
it is not swamped by the non-event gridpoints.
<p>A probabilistic form of the correspondence ratio, <i>CR<sub>p</sub></i>,
can be used to verify ensemble forecasts:

<p>and <i>P</i> is the chosen probability threshold. When <i>P</i>=100%
then <i>CR<sub>p</sub></i>=<i>CR</i>. When <i>P</i>=50% then <i>CR<sub>p</sub></i>
measures the fractional area of agreement of at least half of the ensemble
members with the observations.
