<h2 id="Purpose">What is this website about?</h2>

This web site:
<ul class="dot-points">
<li>Describes methods for forecast verification, including their characteristics,
pros and cons. The methods range from simple traditional statistics and
scores, to methods for more detailed diagnostic and scientific verification.</li>
<li>Gives examples for each method, with links and references for further
information. The examples are all drawn from the meteorological world (since
the <a href="index.html#Contributors_to_this_site">people creating this web</a> site
are themselves meteorologists or work with meteorologists), but the
verification methods can easily be applied in other fields. They are appropriate
for verifying <i>estimates</i> as well as forecasts.</li>
<li>Demonstrates the verification techniques on a handful of forecast examples.
These data will be available for download if you want to try out some of
the techniques.</li>
<li>Does not provide source code&nbsp; (sorry, but what language would
we use?). However, the simple methods are relatively easy to code, and
the complex ones give references to people who have developed them or
are working on them.</li>
<li>Is a <b><i>dynamic site</i></b> - please contribute your ideas and
verification methods, also suggestions for making the site better.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Definition">What is forecast verification?</h2>

If we take the term <i>forecast</i> to mean <i>a prediction of the future
state</i> (of the weather, stock market prices, or whatever), then <i>forecast
verification</i> is the process of assessing the quality of a forecast.
<p>The forecast is compared, or <i>verified</i>, against a
corresponding observation of what actually occurred, or some good
estimate of the true outcome. The verification can be qualitative ("does it look
right?") or quantitative ("how accurate was it?"). In either case it should give
you information about the nature of the forecast errors.
</p>

<h2 id="Why">Why verify?</h2>

A forecast is like an experiment -- given a set of conditions, you make
a hypothesis that a certain outcome will occur. You wouldn't consider
an experiment to be complete until you determined its outcome. In the same
way, you shouldn't consider a forecast experiment to be complete until
you find out whether the forecast was successful.
<p>The three most important reasons to verify forecasts are:
</p>
<ul class="dot-points">
<li>to <i>monitor</i> forecast quality - how accurate are the forecasts
and are they improving over time?</li>
<li>to <i>improve</i> forecast quality - the first step toward getting
better is discovering what you're doing wrong.</li>
<li>to <i>compare</i> the quality of different forecast systems - to what
extent does one forecast system give better forecasts than another, and
in what ways is that system better?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Types">Types of forecasts and verification</h2>

There are many types of forecasts, each of which calls for slightly
different methods of verification. The table below lists one way of
distinguishing forecasts, along with verification methods that are appropriate for
that type of forecast. David Stephenson proposed a <a href="site/forecast-types.pdf">classification
scheme for forecasts</a>. It is often possible to convert from one type
of forecast to another simply by rearranging, categorizing, or
thresholding the data.

<h2 id="Goodness">What makes a forecast good?</h2>

Allan Murphy, a pioneer in the field of forecast verification, wrote an
essay on what makes a forecast "good" (<a href="index.html#Murphy1993">Murphy,
1993</a>). He distinguished three types of "goodness":
<p>
<b><i>Consistency</i></b> - the degree to which the forecast corresponds to 
the forecaster's best judgement about the situation, based upon his/her knowledge base
</p><p>
<b><i>Quality</i></b> - the degree to which the forecast corresponds
to what actually happened
</p><p>
<b><i>Value</i></b> - the degree to which the forecast helps a
decision maker to realize some incremental economic and/or other benefit
</p><p>
<p>Since we're interested in forecast verification, let's look a bit closer
at the forecast <b><i>quality</i></b>. Murphy described nine aspects
(called "attributes") that contribute to the quality of a forecast. These are:
<ul class="dot-points">
<li><b>Bias</b> - the correspondence between the mean forecast and mean observation.</li>
<li><b>Association</b> - the strength of the linear relationship between
the forecasts and observations (for example, the correlation
coefficient measures this linear relationship)</li>
<li><b>Accuracy</b> - the level of agreement between the forecast and the
truth (as represented by observations). The difference between the
forecast and the observation is the <i>error</i>. The lower the errors, the
greater the accuracy.</li>
<li><b>Skill</b> - the relative accuracy of the forecast over some
reference forecast. The reference forecast is generally an unskilled forecast
such as random chance, persistence (defined as the most recent set of
observations, "persistence" implies no change in condition), or climatology. Skill
refers to the increase in accuracy due purely to the "smarts" of the forecast
system. Weather forecasts may be more accurate simply because the
weather is easier to forecast -- skill takes this into account.</li>
<li><b>Reliability</b> - the average agreement between the forecast values
and the observed values. If all forecasts are considered together, then
the <i>overall reliability</i> is the same as the <i>bias</i>. If the
forecasts are stratified into different ranges or categories, then the
reliability is the same as the <i>conditional bias</i>, i.e., it has a different
value for each category.</li>
<li><b>Resolution</b> - the ability of the forecast to sort or resolve
the set of events into subsets with different frequency distributions.
This means that the distribution of outcomes when "A" was forecast is
different from the distribution of outcomes when "B" is forecast. Even if the
forecasts are wrong, the forecast system has resolution if it can successfully
separate one type of outcome from another.</li>
<li><b>Sharpness</b> - the tendency of the forecast to predict extreme
values. To use a counter-example, a forecast of "climatology" has no sharpness.
Sharpness is a property of the forecast only, and like resolution, a forecast
can have this attribute even if it's wrong (in this case it would have
poor reliability).</li>
<li><b>Discrimination</b> - ability of the forecast to discriminate among
observations, that is, to have a higher prediction frequency for an
outcome whenever that outcome occurs.</li>
<li><b>Uncertainty</b> - the variability of the observations. The greater
the uncertainty, the more difficult the forecast will tend to be.
Traditionally, forecast verification has emphasized <i>accuracy</i>
and <i>skill</i>. It's important to note that the other attributes of
forecast performance also have a strong influence on the <i>value</i> of the
forecast.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Quality_vs_value">Forecast quality vs. forecast value</h2>

Forecast quality is not the same as forecast value. A forecast has high
<i>quality</i> if it predicts the observed conditions well according to some objective
or subjective criteria. It has <i>value</i> if it helps the user to make a better decision.
<p>
Imagine a situation in which a high resolution numerical weather
prediction model predicts the development of isolated thunderstorms in a
particular region, and thunderstorms are indeed observed in the region but not in
the particular spots suggested by the model. According to most standard
verification measures this forecast would have poor quality, yet it
might be very valuable to the forecaster in issuing a public weather forecast.
</p><p>
An example of a forecast with high quality but little value is a
forecast of clear skies over the Sahara Desert during the dry season.
</p><p>
When the cost of a missed event is high, the deliberate overforecasting
of a rare event may be justified, even though a large number of false
alarms may also result. An example of such a circumstance is the occurence of
fog at airports. In this case quadratic scoring rules (those involving
squared errors) will tend to penalise such forecasts harshly, and a
positively oriented score such as "hit rate" may be more useful.
</p><p>
<a href="index.html#Katz_and_Murphy_1997">Katz and Murphy (1997)</a>, 
<a href="index.html#Thornes_and_Stephenson_2001">Thornes and Stephenson (2001)</a> 
and <a href="index.html#Wilks_2001">Wilks (2001)</a> describe methods for assessing the 
value of weather forecasts. The <a href="index.html#relative_value">relative value plot</a> 
is sometimes used as a verification diagnostic.
</p>

<h2 id="Truth">What is truth?</h2>

The "truth" data that we use to verify a forecasts generally comes from
observational data. These could be rain gauge measurements, temperature
observations, satellite-derived cloud cover, geopotential height
analyses, and so on.
<p>
In many cases it is difficult to know the exact truth because there
are errors in the observations. Sources of uncertainty include random
and bias errors in the measurements themselves, sampling error and other
errors of representativeness, and analysis error when the observational data
are analyzed or otherwise altered to match the scale of the forecast.
</p><p>
Rightly or wrongly, most of the time we ignore the errors in the
observational data. We can get away with this if the errors in the observations are
much smaller than the expected error in the forecast (high signal to noise
ratio). Even skewed or under-sampled verification data can give us a good idea
of which forecast&nbsp; products are better than others when
intercomparing different forecast methods. Methods to account for errors in the
verification data currently being researched.
</p>

<h2 id="Validity">Validity of verification results</h2>

The verification results are naturally more trustworthy when the quantity
and quality of the verification data are high. It is always a good idea
to put some error bounds on the verification results themselves. It is
especially important (a) for rare events where the sample size is typically
small, (b) when the data shows a lot of variability, and (c) when you
want to know whether one forecast product is significantly better (in a
statistical sense) than another.
<p>
The usual approach is to determine confidence intervals for the
verification scores using analytic, approximate, or 
<a href="site/BootstrapCIs.html">bootstrapping methods</a> (depending
on the score). Some good meteorological references on this subject are
<a href="index.html#Seaman_et_al_1996">Seaman et al. (1996)</a>, 
<a href="index.html#Wilks">Wilks (2011, ch.5)</a>, 
<a href="index.html#Hamill_1999">Hamill (1999)</a>, and 
<a href="index.html#Kane_and_Brown_2000">Kane and Brown (2000)</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="Pooling_vs_stratifying">Pooling vs. stratifying results</h2>

To get reliable verification statistics, a large number of forecast/observations pairs 
(samples) may be pooled over time and/or space. The larger the number of samples, 
the more reliable the verification results. You can also get pooled results by 
aggregating verification statistics over a longer time period, but be careful to 
<a href="site/aggregation/guidelines.html">handle non-linear scores properly</a>.
<p>
The danger with pooling samples, however, is that it can mask
variations in forecast performance when the data are not homogeneous. It
can bias the results toward the most commonly sampled regime (for
example, regions with higher station density, or days with no severe weather).
Non-homegeneous samples can lead to overestimates of forecast skill using
some commonly used metrics - <a href="index.html#Hamill_and_Juras_2005">Hamill
and Juras (2005)</a> provide some clear examples of how this can occur.
</p><p>
Stratifying the samples into quasi-homogeneous subsets (by season,
by geographical region, by intensity of the observations, etc.) helps
to tease out forecast behavior in particular regimes. When doing this, be
sure that the subsets contain enough samples to give
trustworthy verification results.

<section> <!-- Standard verification methods for various kinds of forecasts --------------------------------------------------->
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2 id="Standard">Standard verification methods</h2>

<h3><a id="Eyeball_method"></a>"Eyeball" verification</h3>

<p>One of the oldest and best verification methods is the good old
fashioned visual, or "eyeball", method: look at the forecast and observations
side by side and use human judgment to discern the forecast errors. Common
ways to present data are as time series and maps.
</p><br>
<img src="site/timeseries.gif" alt="Time series of temperature forecasts and observations" width="372" height="178" class="left">
<img src="site/DWDmaps.gif" alt="Rainfall forecast and observations" width="320" height="152" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
<p>
The eyeball method is great if you only have a few forecasts, or you
have lots of time, or you're not interested in quantitative verification
statistics. Even when you do want statistics, it is a very good idea to
look at the data from time to time!
</p><p>
However, the eyeball method is not quantitative, and it is very
prone to individual, subjective biases of interpretation. Therefore it must
be used with caution in any formal verification procedure.
</p><p>
The following sections give fairly brief descriptions of the
standard verification methods and scores for dichotomous, multi-category,
continuous, and probabilistic forecasts. For greater detail and discussion of the
standard methods see <a href="index.html#Stanski_et_al.">Stanski et al. (1989)</a> 
or one of the excellent <a href="index.html#Books">books</a> 
on forecast verification and statistics.
</p>

<h2 id="Dichotomous">Methods for dichotomous (yes/no) forecasts</h2>

<p>A dichotomous forecast says, "yes, an event will happen", or "no,
the event will not happen". Rain and fog prediction are common examples of
yes/no forecasts. For some applications a threshold may be specified to
separate "yes" and "no", for example, winds greater than 50 knots.
</p><p>
To verify this type of forecast&nbsp; we start with a <a href="index.html#Contingency_table">contingency table</a> 
that shows the frequency of "yes" and "no" forecasts and occurrences.
The four combinations of forecasts (yes or no) and observations (yes or
no), called the <i>joint distribution</i>, are:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>hit</i> - event forecast to occur, and did occur
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>miss</i> - event forecast not to occur, but did occur
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>false alarm</i> - event forecast to occur, but did not occur
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>correct negative</i> - event forecast not to occur, and did not occur
</p><p>
The total numbers of observed and forecast occurrences and non-occurences
are given on the lower and right sides of the contingency table, and
are called the <i>marginal distribution</i>.
</p>
<a id="Contingency_table"></a><br>

<br>
<p>The contingency table is a useful way to see what types of errors are
being made. A perfect forecast system would produce only
<i>hits</i> and <i>correct negatives</i>, and no <i>misses</i> or <i>false alarms</i>.
</p><p>
A large variety of <i>categorical statistics</i> are computed from the
elements in the contingency table to describe particular aspects of forecast
performance. We will illustrate these statistics using a (made-up) example.
Suppose a year's worth of official daily rain forecasts and
observations produced the following contingency table:

when correct negatives have been removed from consideration, that is, <i>TS</i>
is only concerned with forecasts that count. Sensitive to hits,
penalizes both misses and false alarms. Does not distinguish source of forecast

<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Measures the fraction of observed and/or forecast

random chance (for example, it is easier to correctly forecast rain
occurrence in a wet climate than in a dry climate). The <i>ETS</i> is often used
in the verification of rainfall in NWP models because its "equitability"
allows scores to be compared more fairly across different regimes. Sensitive
to hits. Because it penalises both misses and false alarms in the same way,
it does not distinguish the source of forecast error.
</p>
<p class="green">In the example above, <i>ETS</i> = (82-34) / (82+23+38-34) = 0.44.

<p><b>Range:</b> -1 to 1, 0 indicates no skill. <b>Perfect score:</b> 1.
</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Uses all elements in contingency table. Does
not depend on climatological event frequency. The expression is
identical to <i>HK = POD - POFD</i>, but the Hanssen and Kuipers score can also
be interpreted as <i>(accuracy for events) + (accuracy for non-events) - 1</i>.
For rare events <i>HK</i> is unduly weighted toward the first term (same
as <i>POD</i>), so this score may be more useful for more frequent events.
Can be expressed in a form similar to the <i>ETS</i> except the <i>hits<sub>random</sub></i>
term is unbiased. See <a href="index.html#Woodcock_1976">Woodcock (1976)</a>

chance. This is a form of the <a href="index.html#Skill_score">generalized skill
score</a>, where the <i>score</i> in the numerator is the number of correct

</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Measures the ratio of the odds of making a
hit to the odds of making a false alarm. The logarithm of the odds ratio is
often used instead of the original value. Takes prior probabilities
into account. Gives better scores for rarer events. Less sensitive to
hedging. Do not use if any of the cells in the contingency table are equal to
0.&nbsp; Used widely in medicine but not yet in meteorology -- 
see <a href="index.html#Stephenson_2000">Stephenson (2000)</a> for more information.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the odds ratio is not the same as the
ratio of the <i>probability</i> of making a hit (<i>hits / # forecasts</i>) to the 
<i>probability</i> of making a false alarm (<i>false alarms / # forecasts</i>),
since both of those can depend on the climatological frequency (i.e.,
the prior probability) of the event.
</p>
<p class="green">In the example above, <i>OR</i> = (82 x 222) / (23 x 38) = 20.8,

<p>The <i>distributions approach</i> to forecast verification examines
the relationship among the elements in the multi-category contingency
table. A perfect forecast system would have values of non-zero elements only
along the diagonal, and values of 0 for all entries off the diagonal. The
off-diagonal elements give information about the specific nature of the forecast
errors. The marginal distributions (<i>N</i>'s at right and bottom of table)
show whether the forecast produces the correct distribution of categorical
values when compared to the observations.
<a href="index.html#Murphy_and_Winkler_1987">Murphy
and Winkler (1987)</a>, <a href="index.html#Murphy_et_al_1989">Murphy et al. (1989)</a>
and <a href="index.html#Brooks_and_Doswell_1996">Brooks and Doswell (1996)</a> develop
this approach in detail.
</p>
<p>The advantage of the distributions approach is that the nature of
the forecast errors can more easily be diagnosed. The disadvantage is that
it is more difficult to condense the results into a single number.
There are fewer statistics that summarize the performance of multi-category
forecasts. However, any multi-category forecast verification can be converted to a
series of <i>K</i>-1 yes/no-type verifications by defining "yes" to be
"in category <i>i</i>" or "in category <i>i</i> or higher", and "no"
to be "not in category <i>i</i>" or "below category <i>i</i>".

<h2 id="Probabilistic">Methods for probabilistic forecasts</h2>

<p>A probabilistic forecast gives a <i>probability</i> of an event occurring,
with a value between 0 and 1 (or 0 and 100%). In general, it is difficult
to verify a single probabilistic forecast. Instead, a set of probabilistic
forecasts, <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>, is verified using observations that those
events either occurred (<i>o<sub>i</sub></i>=1) or did not occur (<i>o<sub>i</sub></i>=0).
</p>
<p>An accurate probability forecast system has:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>reliability</i> - agreement between
forecast probability and mean observed frequency
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>sharpness</i> - tendency to forecast
probabilities near 0 or 1, as opposed to values clustered around the mean
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>resolution</i> - ability of the forecast
to resolve the set of sample events into subsets with characteristically
different outcomes

<p><a id="reliability"></a>- - - - - - - - - - -
</p>
<img src="site/ReliabilityDiagram.gif" alt="Reliability diagram" width="326" height="321" class="right">
<p><b><i>Reliability diagram</i></b> - (called "attributes diagram"
when the no-resoloution and no-skill w.r.t. climatology lines are included).</p>
<p>The reliability diagram plots the observed frequency against the
forecast probability, where the range of forecast probabilities is divided into
<i>K</i> bins (for example, 0-5%, 5-15%, 15-25%, etc.). The sample size in each
bin is often included as a histogram or values beside the data points.
</p>
<p><b>Answers the question:</b><i> How well do the predicted
probabilities of an event correspond to their observed frequencies?</i>
</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Reliability is indicated by the proximity of
the plotted curve to the diagonal. The deviation from the diagonal gives
the <i>conditional bias</i>. If the curve lies below the line, this
indicates overforecasting (probabilities too high); points above the line
indicate underforecasting (probabilities too low). The flatter the curve in the
reliability diagram, the less resolution it has. A forecast of
climatology does not discriminate at all between events and non-events, and thus
has no resolution. Points between the "no skill" line and the diagonal
contribute positively to the <a href="index.html#BSS">Brier skill score</a>. The frequency
of forecasts in each probability bin (shown in the histogram) shows the
sharpness of the forecast.
<br>
The reliability diagram is conditioned on the forecasts (i.e., given
that an event was predicted, what was the outcome?), and can be expected to give
information on the real meaning of the forecast. It is a good partner
to the <a href="index.html#ROC">ROC</a>, which is conditioned on the observations. Some
users may find a reliability table (table of observed relative frequency associated with 
each forecast probability) easier to understand than a reliability diagram.

<p><b>Characteristics:</b> ROC measures the ability of the forecast to
discriminate between two alternative outcomes, thus measuring resolution.
It is not sensitive to bias in the forecast, so says nothing about reliability.
A biased forecast may still have good resolution and produce a good ROC
curve, which means that it may be possible to improve the forecast through 
calibration. The ROC can thus be considered as a measure of potential usefulness.
<br>

</p>
<p><b>Answers the question:</b> <i>How does the skill of spatial precipitation forecasts 
depend on both the scale of the forecast error and the intensity of the precipitation events?</i><br>
</p>
<p>The intensity-scale verification approach bridges
traditional categorical binary verification, which provides information
about skill for different precipitation intensities, with the more
recent techniques which evaluate the forecast skill on different
spatial scales (e.g., Zepeda-Arce et al., 2000; Briggs and Levine, 1997). 
It assesses the forecast on its whole domain, and is well suited for verifying 
spatially discontinuous fields, such as precipitation fields characterized by the 
presence of many scattered precipitation events. It provides useful insight on
individual forecast cases as well as for forecast systems evaluated over many cases.<br>
</p>
<p>Forecasts are assessed using the Mean Squared Error
(MSE) skill score of binary images, obtained from the forecasts and
analyses by thresholding at different precipitation rate intensities.
The skill score is decomposed on different spatial scales using a
two-dimensional discrete Haar wavelet decomposition of binary error
images. The forecast skill can then be evaluated in terms of precipitation 
rate intensity and spatial scale. <br>

</p>
<p><b>Answers the question: </b><i>What are
the spatial scales at which the forecast resembles the observations?</i>
</p>
<p>This approach directly compares the forecast and observed
fractional coverage of grid-box events (rain exceeding a certain
threshold, for example) in spatial windows of increasing size. These
event frequencies are used directly to compute a Fractions Brier Score,
a version of the more familiar (half) <a href="index.html#BS">Brier score</a>
but now the observation can take any value between 0 and 1. The result can be
framed as a Fractions Skill Score
</p>
<img alt="Equation for fractions skill score" src="site/FSS.gif" width="201" height="93">
<p>where <i>P<sub>f</sub></i> is the forecast fraction,
<i>P<sub>o</sub></i> is the observed fraction, and <i>N</i>
is the number of spatial windows in the domain.</p>
<p>FSS has the following properties:</p>
<ul class="dot-points">
  <li>The Fractions Skill Score ranges from 0 (complete mismatch) to 1 (perfect match). </li>
  <li>If either there are no events forecast and some occur, or some occur and 
  none are forecast the score is always 0.</li>
  <li>The value of FSS above which the forecasts are considered to have useful 
  (better than random) skill is given by 
  <i>FSS<sub>useful</sub></i> = 0.5 + <i>f<sub>o</sub></i>/2, where 
  <i>f<sub>o</sub></i> is the domain average observed fraction. The smallest
  window size for which <i>FSS</i> ≥ <i>FSS<sub>useful</sub></i> can be considered
  the "skillful scale".</li>
  <li>As the size of the squares used to compute the fractions gets larger, the score 
  will asympotote to a value that depends on the ratio between the forecast and observed frequencies
  of the event. The closer the asymptotic value is to 1, the smaller the forecast bias.</li>

</p>
<p>Neighborhood verification approaches reward closeness by relaxing
the requirement for exact matches between forecasts and observations.
Some of these neighborhood methods compute standard verification metrics for
deterministic forecasts using a broader definition of what constitutes a "hit".
Other neighborhood methods treat the forecasts and/or observations as probability
distributions and use verification metrics suitable for probability forecasts.
Implicit in each neighborhood verification method is a particular decision model
concerning what constitutes a good forecast.</p>
<p>The key to the neighborhood approach is the use of a spatial window or
neighborhood surrounding the forecast and/or observed points. The treatment of
the points within the window may include averaging (upscaling), thresholding,
or generation of a PDF, depending on the neighborhood method used. The size of this
neighborhood can be varied to provide verification results at multiple scales,
thus allowing the user to determine at which scales the forecast has useful
skill. Other windows could be included to represent closeness in time,
closeness in intensity, and/or closeness in some other important aspect.

</p>
<p><b>Answers the question:</b><i>
What is the location error of the (spatial) forecast, and how does the total error break
down into components due to incorrect location, volume, and fine scale structure?</i>
<br>
<img src="site/CRA_entities0.gif" alt="CRA entities" width="260" height="111" class="right">
<br>This object-oriented method verifies the properties of spatial forecasts of <i>entities</i>,
where an entity is anything that can be defined by a closed contour. Some
examples of entities, or blobs, are contiguous rain areas (CRAs, for which
the method is named), convective outlook regions, and low pressure minima.
For each entity that can be identified in the forecast and the observations,
CRA verification uses pattern matching techniques to determine the location
error, as well as errors in area, mean and maximum intensity, and spatial
pattern. The total error can be decomposed into components due to location,
volume, and pattern error. This is a useful property for model developers
who need such information to improve the numerical weather prediction models.
</p>
<p>In addition, the verified entities themselves may be classified as "hits",
"misses", etc., according to how close the forecast location was to the
observed location, and how well the maximum intensity was represented by
the forecast. This event verification can be useful for monitoring forecast performance.

</p>
<p><b>Answers the question:</b><i> How similar are the forecast objects to the observed
 objects according to a variety of descriptive criteria ?</i></p>
<p>MODE uses a convolution filter and thresholding to first
identify objects in gridded fields. Performance at different spatial
scales can be investigated by varying the values of the filter and threshold parameters.
Then a fuzzy logic scheme is used to merge objects within a field, and match them between  
the forecast and the observations. Several attributes of the matched objects
(location, area, volume, intensity, shape, etc.) are compared
to see how similar they are. These are combined to give an "interest value"
that summarizes the goodness of the match.</p>
<p>Output of the MODE algorithm include:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attributes of single matched shapes (i.e., hits)</li>
  <li>Attributes of single unmatched shapes (i.e., false alarms, misses)</li>
  <li>Attributes of clustered objects (i.e., groups of forecast or observed
objects that are merged together)</li>
  <li>Attributes of interest to specific users (e.g., gaps between
storms, for aviation strategic planning)</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes can be summarized across many cases to understand how forecasts 
represent the storm/precipitation climatology, understand systematic errors, and
document variability in performance in different situations.</p>

<p>This approach considers both high and low pressure centers, troughs,

</p>
<p>Gridded forecasts and analyses of mean sea level pressure are meridionally
averaged within a zonal strip to give an east-west series of forecast and
analyzed values. Cosine series trigonometric approximations are applied
to both series, and the variance associated with each spectral
component is computed. These are then sorted in descending order of variance to
get the hierarchy of most important waves. If the hierarchies agree between
the forecast and analyzed spectral components, then the phase angle
(error) can be computed for each component.
</p>
<p>In practice, the first spectral component is usually responsible for most
of the variance and is the main one of interest. The phase errors are presented as time series.

<b>Answers the question:</b><i>
What is the distance between forecast and observed features?</i>
<p>Measuring the distance between observed and
forecast features is not only an intuitive error measure for many users, but
also avoids the double-counting penalty where a feature displaced in space is
scored worse than either a complete miss or a false alarm since it is penalized
as both at once. The Displacement and Amplitude Score (DAS) is based on an
optical flow algorithm that defines a vector field that deforms, or morphs, one
image to match another. In DAS distance and amplitude errors are combined to
produce a single measure. The optical flow method does not require
identification and matching of discrete objects, which is often subjective and
sensitive to many parameters in the algorithms.

The figure to the right shows the observed radar reflectivity (top left),
forecast reflectivity (top right), forecast superimposed with displacement vector field
matching the forecast onto the observation (bottom left), and morphed forecast

displacement vector length and the root mean square error of morphed forecast

</p>
<p>Also known as a "Talagrand diagram", this method checks where the verifying
observation usually falls with respect to the ensemble forecast data, which
is arranged in increasing order at each grid point. In an ensemble with
perfect spread, each member represents an equally likely scenario, so the
observation is equally likely to fall between any two members.
</p>
<p>To construct a rank histogram, do the following:
<ol class="spaced-list">
<li>At every observation (or analysis) point rank the <i>N</i> ensemble
members from lowest to highest. This represents N+1 possible bins that
the observation could fit into, including the two extremes</li>
<li>Identify which bin the observation falls into at each point</li>
<li>Tally over many observations to create a histogram of rank.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interpretation:
<br>
Flat - ensemble spread about right to represent forecast uncertainty
<br>
U-shaped - ensemble spread too small, many observations falling outside
the extremes of the ensemble
<br>
Dome-shaped - ensemble spread too large, most observations falling
near the center of the ensemble
<br>
Asymmetric - ensemble contains bias
</p>
<p>Note: A flat rank histogram does not necessarily indicate a good forecast,
it only measures whether the observed probability distribution is well
represented by the ensemble.

as the forecast approaches perfection, whereas it is possible to optimize
EDS and EDI for biased forecasts.

<p>In an approach that is conceptually similar to the Taylor diagram, it is possible 
to exploit the geometric relationship between
four measures of dichotomous forecast performance: probability of
detection (POD), false alarm ratio or its opposite, the success ratio
(SR), bias and critical success index (CSI; also known as the threat
score). For good forecasts, POD, SR, bias and CSI approach unity, such
that a perfect forecast lies in the upper right of the diagram. Skill is
assessed by plotting the forecast quality measure relative to a reference forecast (climatology,
persistence or any other desired baseline). <br>

  <img src="site/RMSF.gif" alt="root mean square factor" width="235" height="74">
</div>
<p><b>Answers the question:</b><i> What is the average multiplicative error?</i>
</p>
<p>The <i>RMSF</i> is the exponent of the root mean square error of the
logarithm of the data. The logarithmic transformation is performed to smooth the
data, reduce the discontinuities, and make the data more robust.
Whereas the RMS error can be interpreted as giving a scale to the additive
error, i.e., <b><i>f</i></b> = <b><i>o</i></b> ± <b><i>RMS</i></b>, the RMSF
can be interpreted as giving a scale to the multiplicative error, i.e.,
<b><i>f</i></b> = <b><i>o</i></b> ×/÷ <b><i>RMSF</i></b> (read: "multiplied or divided
by"), which is a more appropriate measure of accuracy for some variables
and more intuitively meaningful than the RMS log error. In order to
avoid assigning skill to trivial forecasts, statistics are only accumulated
where either the forecast or observations are within specified limits. For
example, for visibility verification, the lower and upper limits used by Golding
(1998) were 1 m and 5000 m. When either the forecast or the observation
lies within the range but the other is outside the range, then limits
of half the lower limit or double the upper limit are prescribed on the other.

Deterministic limit</a></i></b> <a href="index.html#Hewson2007">(Hewson, 2007)</a></p>
<p><a><b>Answers the question:</b><i> What is the length of time into the forecast 
in which the forecast is more likely to be correct than incorrect?</i>
</a></p>
<p><a>The 'deterministic limit' is defined, for
categorical forecasts of a pre-defined rare meteorological event, to
simply be the point ahead of issue time at which, across the
population, the number of misses plus false alarms equals the number of
hits (i.e. </a><a href="index.html#CSI">critical success index</a>
=0.5). A hypothetical example of an accuracy statement that might thus
arise would be: 'The deterministic limit for predicting a windstorm,
with gusts in excess of 60 kts at one or more low-lying inland stations
in NW Europe, is 2.1 days'. The base rate (or event frequency) should
also be disclosed. Recalibration of the forecast is often necessary for
useful deterministic limit measures to be realised. </p>
<p>As they provide a clear measure of capability,
deterministic limit values for various parameters may in due course be
used as year-on-year performance indicators, and also to provide
succinct guidelines for warning service provision. They could also be
used as the cut-off point to switch from deterministic to probabilistic
guidance. In turn this may help elevate the hitherto muted enthusiasm
shown, by some customers, for probabilistic forecasts.

<b><i>Quantile-based categorical statistics</i></b>&nbsp;
(<a href="index.html#Jenkner_2008">Jenkner et al., 2008</a>) 
<p>Dichotomous forecasts can be thought of in terms of
statistical frequencies instead of physical amplitudes. If the marginal
totals of the contingency table are fixed by means of quantiles,
categorical statistics benefit from some inherent advantages. The
verification problem automatically is calibrated and the degrees of
freedom reduce to one, allowing the potential accuracy of the
calibrated forecast to be described using a single score. The total
error can be split up into the bias and the potential accuracy,
which can be measured by the quantile difference and the debiased <a href="index.html#HK">
Peirce's Skill Score</a>, respectively. These two quantities
provide a complete verification set with the ability to assess the full
range of intensities. The verification can be computed for certain quantiles, 
as shown at right for the COSMO model's QPF performance over six predefined
regions in Switzerland, or it can be aggregated over intensities by
means of appropriate summary measures.</p>

<h3 id="Finley"><i>Finley tornado forecasts</i></h3>

This is a classic example used in many textbooks and talks on forecast
verification to illustrate the characteristics of the various categorical verification scores.
<p>In March 1884 Sergeant John Finley initiated twice daily tornado forecasts
for eighteen regions in the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains.
Finley claimed 95.6% to 98.6% overall accuracy for the first 3-month period,
depending on the time and district, with some districts achieving 100%
accuracy for all 3 months. A critic of the results pointed out that 98.2%
accuracy could be had by merely forecasting "no tornado"! This clearly
illustrates the need for more meaningful verification scores.

<h3><i>Climate Explorer</i></h3>

The <a href="http://climexp.knmi.nl/">Climate Explorer</a> is a web based tool
for performing climate analysis that also includes several options for seasonal
forecast verification. The user is allowed to select a particular season and
variable of interest (e.g., precipitation, 2 metre temperature, sea
surface temperature, sea level pressure, etc.) and a seasonal forecast
model (e.g., ECMWF, UK Met Office, NCEP/CPF, ECHAM4.5, in addition to a
large number of models participating in the EU projects 
<a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/development-european-multimodel-ensemble-system-seasonal-interannual">DEMETER</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ensembles">ENSEMBLES</a>, 
and the corresponding observations prior to performing verification. 
Climate Explorer offers a large number of deterministic and probabilistic scores 
for assessing the performance of seasonal ensemble predictions (e.g., correlation; 
root meansquare error and mean absolute error of the ensemble mean; Brier score
and its decomposition into reliability, resolution and uncertainty;
reliability diagram; Brier skill score; tercile and quintile ranked
probability score; tercile and quintile ranked probability skill score;
and relative operating characteristics (ROC) curve). Forecast
verification results and scores are displayed as spatial maps, diagrams and
single values when the user selects the option for time series verification.
